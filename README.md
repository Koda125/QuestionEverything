This Repo will be a demenstration of my understanding of both React as well as a new learning opportunity on how to utilize OpenAI to create a web based chat bot. The twist however, the chat bot will always return the opposite of the question the user inputs.
I want to make a helpful reminder that AI is not always factual and everything you ask AI can be incorrect. 
This will also serve as a friendly reminder that not everything you read on the internet is the truth.
Lastly, I hope whomever stubbles across this app, enjoys it and sees it the same way that I have invisioned it.
Thanks!
