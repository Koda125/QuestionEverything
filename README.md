This Repo will be a demenstration of my understanding of both React as well as a new learning opportunity on how to utilize OpenAI to create a web based chat bot. The twist however, the chat bot will always return the opposite of the question the user inputs.
I want to make a helpful reminder that AI is not always factual and everything you ask AI can be incorrect. 
This will also serve as a friendly reminder that not everything you read on the internet is the truth.
Lastly, I hope whomever stubbles across this app, enjoys it and sees it the same way that I have invisioned it.

The quickest way to get this app working on your personal computer will be to create your own OpenAI account and get a secret API Key and copy it into both Main.JSX line 11 as well as Game.jsx line 13. Once both of these have been updated, have fun with the options that are available. Two Truths and a Lie, or just ask the AI random questions and see what happens ðŸ˜‰
Thanks!
